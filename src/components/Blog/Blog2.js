This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.Why is the context API useful?
Context is a built-in API introduced in ​​React 16.3. It makes it possible to pass data from parent to children nested deep down the component tree directly, instead of passing it down through a chain of props.What are some applications of using context API?
Context API is introduced in React 16.3. The Context API is used to share the data with multiple components, without having to pass data through props manually.
